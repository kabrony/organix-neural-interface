# ORGANIX Neural Interface - Development Progress

## Recent Updates

### 2025-03-16: Complete Visual & UI Overhaul
- Completely redesigned visualization effects system with cyberpunk aesthetic
- Updated color palette to feature neon green, orange, and light blue tones
- Implemented advanced Three.js shaders for atmospheric effects
- Added volumetric light beams with realistic light scattering
- Created dynamic data flow visualization system
- Enhanced particle system with data stream effects
- Added retro grid environment with CRT-style scanline effects
- Modernized UI with cyberpunk-styled chat interface
- Added iconify integration for improved icons throughout the UI
- Enhanced theme consistency across all components

## Running Locally

To run the ORGANIX Neural Interface locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabrony/organix-neural-interface.git
   cd organix-neural-interface
   ```

2. **Start a local development server:**
   
   Using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   
   Or using Node.js:
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
   
   Or any other static file server of your choice.

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port your server is using)

4. **First run experience:**
   - You'll see a loading screen while the 3D environment initializes
   - After loading, you'll see the neural network visualization with the chat interface on the right
   - The app starts in "Simulation Mode" where Claude responses are simulated
   - Interact with the 3D visualization using your mouse (rotate, zoom, click on nodes)
   - Use the control panel (left side) to adjust visual effects
   - Chat with the simulated Claude through the chat interface (right side)

## Key Features to Try

1. **Interactive 3D Environment:**
   - Click on neural nodes to get information about them
   - Use mouse to rotate, zoom and pan the view
   - Try the "Overview" button to see the entire network

2. **Visual Effects:**
   - Adjust the activity level slider to see more dynamic animations
   - Toggle individual effects on/off to see their impact
   - Try different visual presets from the control panel

3. **Chat Interface:**
   - Ask about different parts of the neural network
   - The visualization will highlight relevant components based on conversation
   - Try asking specific questions about Memory, Perception, Reasoning, or Knowledge nodes

## Next Steps

1. **Real MCP Integration:**
   - Complete integration with real Claude API via MCP protocol
   - Add support for complex conversation context with visualization triggers
   - Implement context-aware responses to user interactions with 3D elements

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Implement dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) system
   - Add GPU instancing for particle systems
   - Optimize shader complexity for lower-end devices

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Add direct neuron manipulation controls
   - Implement advanced query system for neural node information
   - Create visual representations of AI thought processes
   - Add more animated transitions between states
